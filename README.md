# Virtual-CPU-and-Assembler

A virtual CPU and basic assembler that I created in my Computer Organization and Assembly Language course in 2014.

The projects compromise of six assignments that amount to a basic assembler:

- Boolean Logic
- Boolean Algebra
- Sequential Logic
- Central Processing Unit
- The Assembler
- Assembly Language

This course followed the Nand2Tetris program/book found at http://www.nand2tetris.org/.
