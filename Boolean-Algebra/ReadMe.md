Step 1: Click the ‘Run’ button in Eclipse or your Java IDE equivalent in order to start using testing script.
Step 2: You will be presented with a dialog box that contains instructions for that current dialog box. The first dialog box or menu should present either option 1: ‘Assignment 1 gates’ or option 2: ‘Assignment 2 gates’. Type the correct number corresponding to the correct assignment gate list in the white rectangular input box and click the ‘OK’ button to submit and move forward to the next menu.
Step 3: Once you have completed step 2 you will be presented with a similar menu , specify the gate you would like to test from the assignment option chosen in step 2 and click ‘OK’ to advance further.
Step 4: Depending on the gate chosen you will be presented a series of dialog boxes that allow you to enter the parameters that are needed for that gate. The single input requires only one integer value be submitted and the array parameter requires a specified amount of integer that are separated by commas (do not include the brackets for the array, an example will be given to you in the dialog box). Click ‘OK’ to advance to your result. 
Result: A dialog box will appear with the result of your tested gate.
You may click the ‘Exit’ to leave the testing system from the main menu and the ‘Back’ button to return to the previous menu.
